## Welcome to my page

I'm Herberts and I'm an expert in cloud solutions architecture. I love to study and share everything I know about technology, as I believe that knowledge only makes sense if it is shared. I'm not afraid to face challenges, because they make me grow. I like people, I'm only here for their feedback, whether in the position of leader or led, I learn a lot from them.

## Relevant

I manage my time well, recording and prioritizing my tasks, focusing on what is most important and essential. I tend to be accurate or have a small margin of error in my estimates. I am able to communicate with technical audiences or not, I practice active listening, transmitting information with objectivity and persuasion. I am disciplined, so remote work is natural for me since 2019. I believe it is essential to share knowledge, in recent experiences, for example, I had the opportunity to give Dojos, Lectures, Workshops and Training. I am a facilitator leader, who works with a coach and mentor, who favors collaboration and listens to his team members in decisions, as I realize that the team is more efficient when it has ownership and can apply it in a collaborative and self-manageable atmosphere. I received good feedback from excellent professionals who identified in me these skills I mentioned.
